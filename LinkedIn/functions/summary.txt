. Every javaScript object has a prototype property which makes 
iheritance possible in javaScript
. The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and 
    properties that we want other objects to inherit.
. The Constructor's property is Not the prototype not the Constructor
    itself, it's the prototype of All instances that are created through it.
. When a crertain method(or property)is called, the search starts in the object 
itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to the object's prototype.
This continus until the method is found: prototype chain.
